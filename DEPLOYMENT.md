# Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy to Vercel

### Option 1: GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   # Create a new repository on GitHub first, then:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect Next.js settings
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Add Database**
   - After deployment, go to your project dashboard
   - Navigate to "Integrations" tab
   - Find "Neon" in the marketplace and click "Add"
   - Follow the setup wizard to create a new database
   - The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable will be automatically added

4. **Redeploy**
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Click the three dots on the latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - Your app is now live with database!

### Option 2: Vercel CLI

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login and Deploy**
   ```bash
   vercel login
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Add Database** (same as Option 1, step 3-4)

## Environment Variables

The following variable will be automatically set when you add Neon via Vercel marketplace:

```env
DATABASE_URL
```
